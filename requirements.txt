User story:

Users can see the navigation bar that shows "user status"
If the user hasn't signed in, see the sign-in button on the right side
If users have signed in, see the username and a sign out button instead
Users can see the list of jobs on the main page
Users can click on a single job card to pop up a detailed job modal
If the user haven't signed in, pop up a sign in modal
Users can sign in with a fixed username and password (don't have to sign up) and sign out. Then the application will navigate the user to the expected page.
ðŸš€ The demo is missing a search function? Can you implement it?
ðŸš€ The login modal matchs the url /login.
